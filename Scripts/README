============================
How to Create Monthly Report
============================

The monthly report is automatically created by cron job on 3rd of every month.
However, it cannot run ds9 without the screen and you need to run it manually. 

    1. open a clean window (no ascds)
    2. source /proj/sot/ska/bin/ska_envs.csh
    3. run:  /data/mta/Script/Month/Scripts/dose_map_creation.py

If you like to run the entier process manually:

    1. open a clean window (no ascds)
    2. source /proj/sot/ska/bin/ska_envs.csh
    3. run: /data/mta/Script/Month/Scripts/create_monthly.py

For the latter, you don't need to run dose_map_creation.py separately. 

You can also run a specific month by:

    3. run: /data/mta/Script/Month/Scripts/create_monthly.py <yyyy> <m>
        e.g., /data/mta/Script/Month/Scripts/create_monthly.py 2016 5


Cron job:
On r2d2-v as mta:
40 6 3 * *  cd /data/mta/Script/Month; /data/mta/Script/Month/monthly_wrap_script > /data/mta/Script/Month/report_creation.cron
