1. start arc4gl, and get a list of evt1 data for the month:

        operation=browse
        dataset=flight
        detector=acis
        level=1	
(	version=last    ) -- do without this
        filetype=evt1
        tstart=<starting date of the month>
        tstop=<ending data of the month>

   NOTE: you may want to delay this as late as you can, since the data may not get into
         archieve till several day after the observation.

2. save the list in "list".

3 run get_img_data.perl <USER> <PASS>, where <USER> is your arc4gl user name, and
  <PASS> is your password.

4. this creates img fits files. group them into about 20 each and save in files
        NOTE: watch the process. once in a while even one file exceeds I4 bit max. level.
              if that happens, convert the fits file with step 6 and save aside.

5. rename one of the file to img_list, then run comb_img_data.perl
   output file name is: total.fits

6. change the bit system by:
        chimgtyp total.fits out1.fits datatype=LONG

7. repeat 5 and 6 for all groups, then combined out1.fits, out2.fits.... with
   fimgmerge

8. compute stat with fimgstat and comp_stat.perl


9. Creating gif files:
                for the entire image:
                        saotng total_exp.fits -block 4 -winsize 720
                        flip the image (select from scale)
                        set color to heat, scale to histogram
                        select save screen to gif file from "Images"

                for the I3/S3
                        saotng total_exp.fits -block 4
                        magnify 2x
                        pan to the chip
                        rests are same as above

* Get a list of data
        - arc4gl to access archive
        - browse for acis evt1 files for the month
        - make a list of the acis*evt1.fits of the month
          save it in a file "list". name only (e.g.,acisf00737_000N001_evt1.fits)
        - run dm_img.perl to get total exposure map
          -creates image using
            [dmcopy '*.fits[events][bin tdetx=2800:5200:1, tdety=1650:4150:1]'
                   out*.fits option=image]
        - copy and run comp_stat.perl to get statistics for I2/3 and S2/3.

          all up-dated scripts are kept in /data/mta2/isobe/Exposure. The version in
          pool space may not be current; so always copy scripts from
          /data/mta2/isobe/Exposure.

        Creating cumulative fits file
                edit total_list: add the last month's image name (then add 0,0 at the end)
                use fimgmerge:
                        fimgmerge jul_total.fits @total_list ACIS_03_07_2000.fits

        Creating gif files:
                for the entire image:
                        saotng total_exp.fits -block 4 -winsize 720
                        flip the image (select from scale)
                        set color to heat, scale to histogram
                        select save screen to gif file from "Images"

                for the I3/S3
                        saotng total_exp.fits -block 4
                        magnify 2x
                        pan to the chip
                        rests are same as above
