create ACIS focal plane temperature trend plot
##############################################

How to run the script
++++++++++++++++++++++

Simply run run_all_focal_scripts. It will creates plots for the last month in Plots directory.




++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
find_focal_temp_peaks_monthly.py
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This script creates a peak profile distribtuion for the month before (assuming no inputs are given). 

Input:
no need to compute the previous month data, but you can also specify the year and the month.

Output:
./Data/this_month_data 
./Data/focal_temp_data


++++++++++++++++++++++++++
plot_focal_temperature.py
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This phyton script computes and plots 10 day moving average trend plots of
focal temperature peak height and width. It also privides a monthly average
of the peak height and width. 

Input:
./Data/this_month_data ---- the month local data of thefocal plane temperature data in the format of 
                     <year> <ydate> <focal temp> <focal temp peak width>

./Data/focal_temp_data ---- same as above but for the entire period.

Ouput:
./Plots/focal_temp_plot.png
./Plots/month_avg           --- a file contains month focal temp peak averge and width average


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
create_monthly_erand_plot.py
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This script creates the monthly focal temperature trend plot.

Input:
No need. It will estimates start and stop time from the "last month" date, but
you can give year and month you want to create a plot

Output:
erand_<mmm><yy>.gif

This script also needs contents of Templates directory and access to arc4gl.
It also uses idl script inside to creates the plot.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
run_all_script_wrap and run_all_script_main
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
These two scripts are control scripts to run all three scripts above


++++++++++
Directory

Scripts:            this directory containing all scripts
Scripts/Templates:  containing several template files used by create_monthly_erand_plot.py
Data:               holds data used by the scripts: this_month_data, focal_temp_data
Plots:              output directory to hold plots and a fitting result
Old:                out of date scripts, data etc
